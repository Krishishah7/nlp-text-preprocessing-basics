# NLP Text Preprocessing

This project demonstrates the basic text preprocessing steps used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python and the NLTK library.

The goal of this project is to convert raw text into a clean and structured format that can be used for further NLP tasks such as text analysis or machine learning models.

---

## 📄 Dataset

The project uses a custom text file (`sample_nlp_text.txt`) containing text related to Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing concepts.

---

## 🧠 Preprocessing Steps Performed

The following preprocessing steps are implemented:

1. Conversion of text to lowercase  
2. Removal of punctuation  
3. Tokenization of text into words  
4. Removal of stopwords  
5. Stemming using Porter Stemmer  
6. Lemmatization using WordNet Lemmatizer  

Both **stemming and lemmatization** are applied to show how words are normalized in different ways.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- Google Colab  

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Upload the text file (`sample_nlp_text.txt`) to the working directory  
2. Run the notebook or script  
3. The output will display:
   - Original text  
   - Lemmatized tokens  
   - Stemmed (processed) tokens  

---

## 📌 Output

The output shows how raw text is transformed after preprocessing, highlighting the difference between stemming and lemmatization.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project is created to understand and practice fundamental NLP preprocessing techniques that are commonly used in real-world NLP applications.
